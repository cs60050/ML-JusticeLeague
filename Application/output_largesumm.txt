Washington (CNN)From the beginning, everyone underestimated Donald Trump.
Trump channeled the fury of average Americans against Washington.
The pundits thought Trump's reality show antics, his vulgar rhetoric, speeches filled with falsehoods and insults thrown at almost every sector of American society -- Latinos, African Americans, war heroes, women and Muslims -- would disqualify him from the presidency.
Changing the map
Trump said he would change the complexion of the electoral map -- putting Democratic states in the decaying industrial Midwest into the Republican column with his anti-trade rhetoric.
Trump's rewriting of the rules of politics could usher in a period of global turmoil and uncertainty, as US allies, foreign markets and the Americans who were revolted by his behavior during the campaign look to the future with deep anxiety.
How politicians, pollsters and media missed Trump's groundswell
The question now, is when he becomes the most powerful man in the world in January, whether Trump will try to rewrite the rules and conventions of American government and the international system, just as fundamentally as he rewrote the rules of American presidential elections.
Clinton allies said the damage was undeniable -- their hope of swaying those final persuadable Republican women and independents -- suddenly looked bleaker.
As late as this weekend, the polls suggested Trump would have to run a near perfect race and chart a very narrow path to the White House, essentially pulling an inside straight.
