##Introductory Presentation:
 Please follow this link to the RoadMap Presentation - [DocSummarization-ML](https://github.com/cs60050/ML-JusticeLeague/blob/master/DocSummarization-ML.pdf)

##Pre-Processing:
 The pre-processing is being done using the following steps -

##Features Identified:
 Our summarizer produces summaries using a feature profile oriented sentence extraction stategy. The following features have been identified as important:
 
    1)  CUE PHRASES
    2)  SIMILARITY TO THE TITLE
    3)  TF-ISF
    4)  DEGREE CENTRALITY
    5)  C-LEX RANK
    6)  TEXT RANK
    7)  NON-ESSENTIAL WORDS (Like "Additionally")
    8)  NUMERICAl DATA
    9)  SENTENCE LENGTH
    10) WORDNET BASED RANKING

## Feature Extraction
  **Mean TF-ISF** 
  
  This feature is analogous to TF-IDF in the context of Information Retrieval. In IR, we have to select few documents which are most relevant from a given set of documents. Here, we have to select few sentences from the given document.The used feature is calculated as the mean value of the TF-ISF measure for all the words of each sentence. The feature is calculated in the following way-

  **Sentence Length** 
  
  Sentences of too short length add little value when included in the summary. This feature is used to penalize such sentences so that they will not be included in final summary.

  **Sentence Position** 
  
  Sentences at the start of the document and also at the end of the document generally have more importance and are candidates to be included in the summary. Even, sentence position in each paragraph is useful, but here the summarizer checks for the overall position and weights accordingly (as it summarizes news articles which generally tend to have information about a single aspect and not divided into paragraphs - Identified from the corpus present with us). This is the graph which shows the normalized weights assigned to sentences-

 **Wordnet Ranking**

   We created list of Keywords by taking Adjectives,nouns and Propernouns.We have calculated number of times a particular word or its synonyms occured in document by using synset.Now if Keyword is a properNoun a score of 1 is assigned or else a highest similarity score is assigned which is calculated with respect to synonyms of other words present in document.Now for each sentence a score is assigned which is (sum of scores of all keywords present in the sentence)/(Number of keywords present in sentence).

 **Other Features**

 	Other features used in the summarization system include Textrank, ProperNouns, NumericalData
