1 Winds hamper rescue of stranded Alaska fishing crew - CNN.com .
1 -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The U.S. Coast Guard on Wednesday was trying to reach the stranded four-man crew of an Alaska-based fishing vessel that ran aground in strong winds in the Bering Sea .

1 The 58-foot ` Icy Mist ' is taking on water after running aground off the coast of Alaska 's remote Akutan Island , part of the Aleutian Islands , according to the Coast Guard .

1 Hurricane-force winds up to 90 mph -LRB- 145 kph -RRB- are hampering the rescue operation , which involves a Coast Guard cutter and a C-130 Hercules aircraft .
2 The strong winds have delayed the arrival of several helicopters to help rescue the skipper and crew , said Petty Officer Walter Shinn , a Coast Guard spokesman .

3 The situation is too dangerous for the C-130 to drop a life raft , he explained .

3 ` They 're up against the rocky shoreline , so it 's really risky right now to drop survival gear , ' Shinn said .
3 ` The water could come and wash them away . '

1 The damaged boat is in danger of breaking up , according to the Coast Guard , which has had intermittent contact with the stranded vessel .

3 ` We are n't really certain ... if anyone 's injured , ' Shinn said .
3 ` We do n't know . '

3 It is unclear if there was an advisory warning ships to avoid the weather , which is severe -- even for the Bering Sea -- according to Shinn .

3 The ship 's owner , Bob Gunderson , said he was unaware of the situation but was confident that it was his boat .
3 He said the skipper and three crew members were fishing for Pacific cod .
3 The Coast Guard received an initial mayday call from the vessel around 4:40 a.m. Alaska time -LRB- 12:40 a.m. ET -RRB- .
