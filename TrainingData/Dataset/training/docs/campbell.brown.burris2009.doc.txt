3 -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The recently appointed senator from Illinois , Roland Burris , asked us to look beyond the Blagojevich scandal and judge him independently .

2 Many people did .
2 Turns out we probably should n't have .

2 Burris , you 'll recall , was impeached Gov. Rod Blagojevich 's gift to the people of Illinois .

3 Plenty of people cried foul at the time , arguing Burris should not be seated .
1 But Democratic senators gave him the benefit of the doubt and welcomed him to the club .
1 Turns out they probably should n't have .
3 Watch Campbell Brown discuss Roland Burris 

2 Burris , who initially said he never tried to raise money for Blagojevich while lobbying for the Senate seat , now has admitted that he did try to raise money for Blagojevich at the request of the governor 's brother .

3 He says the only reason he did n't tell us that is because we did n't ask .
1 Turns out that 's not exactly true either ... he was asked a number of times and dodged the questions .

3 Republicans are already calling for his resignation , and Politico.com is reporting the Senate Ethics Committee will likely launch an investigation .

3 Burris still claims he 's done nothing wrong and says he welcomes the investigation .
