marscher use rock group ' song illustr scientif concept student , einsteinian '' 39 ' queen . .
began write song tailor specif lectur like ` superlumin lover , ' black hole ballad full physic innuendo . .
watch sing ` superlumin lover ' . .
song may much fame , intern team research marscher lead publish breakthrough research black hole phenomena sing . .
black hole somewhat like vacuum cleaner space . .
collaps star suck anyth everyth immedi vicin n't let anyth escap , even light . .
vacuum cleaner idea black hole n't perfect . .
astronom also detect jet stream particl travel nearli speed light , well x-ray gamma ray , shoot black hole . .
use radio telescop set world , marscher colleagu studi black hole nearli 1 billion light year away -lrb- one light year 5.9 trillion mile -rrb- . .
found evid support one theori black hole jet stream . .
matter fall black hole , swirl around like water go drain , marscher said . .
closer thing get black hole , faster begin orbit . .
magnet field twist , like spring coil , said . .
magnet field propel particl along black hole 's rotat pole . .
marscher 's team found direct evid support explan , detect twist magnet field polar light result . .
` paper repres signific advanc field , ' said marc laci , associ research scientist caltech 's spitzer scienc center . .
` author make convinc case 'd see 'd expect see model jet format . ' .

` observ report alan marscher collabor , although definit , convinc novel respect , ' said . .
research eagerli await result nasa 's gamma-ray larg area space telescop , space observatori may provid even insight black hole ' jet stream . .

black hole seen emit light , astronom found substanti evid . .
still , exist telescop power enough observ exactli goe close black hole , laci said . .
` rare object , 's look great distanc away see one whose jet point almost right us , ' marscher said . .
` , see jet point almost right us , jet beam radiat , like halogen flashlight . ' .
although astronom detect black hole deep space , specul black hole could gener larg hadron collid , multibillion-dollar particl acceler develop european organ nuclear research geneva , switzerland . .

` made littl tini black hole laboratori , would n't much graviti . .
would n't suck everyth 's earth ; would suck stuff 's within , say , millimet , ' said . .
` would n't devast danger science-fict writer would say , 'd real tini mass. ' .
still , even laboratory-mad black hole n't kept around long . .
natur suck thing , could grow grow , accumul mass power pull thing . .
` think would put someth lot mass toss space , would n't come contact much matter would n't grow . ' marscher said . .
