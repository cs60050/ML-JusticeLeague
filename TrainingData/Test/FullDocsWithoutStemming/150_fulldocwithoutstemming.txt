A primer on stem cells .
CNN The Food and Drug Administration has approved the first human clinical trial of embryonic stem cell therapy .
The stem cells used for this study came from the 60 existing stem cell lines approved in August 2001 by the Bush administration .
Before that time federal research dollars were not allowed to be used for stem cell research .
To date only 21 of these lines have proved useful to researchers .
What are stem cells ? .
Embryonic stem cells have the potential to turn into any organ or tissue cell in the body .
Stem cells have this ability for a very short time .
Just a few days before the embryo would implant it starts to develop into specific cells that will turn into skin or eyes or other parts of a developing fetus .
How do scientists get stem cells ? .
At this point researchers use embryos that have been created in fertility clinics by taking an egg which is fertilized with a sperm in a petri dish .
Stem cells are not removed from embryos that have been conceived naturally .
The embryos used for research are not intended for making a baby and researchers need to get consent from the parents to use their fertilized eggs for their studies .
When the embryo is 4 or 5 days old scientists extract the stem cells and put them in a petri dish .
With the removal of these stem cells of which there may be about 30 the embryo is destroyed .
This is why some people oppose this type of research .
What is a stem cell line ? .
When human embryonic stem cells are placed in a petri dish they are surrounded by a solution or medium that allows the cells to multiply while still having the potential to turn into any type of body cell .
According to the National Institutes of Health after six months of culturing these original 30 cells can turn into millions of embryonic stem cells .
These millions of stem cells are called a stem cell line .
Researchers will continue to monitor these cells to ensure that their properties have changed .
Where are these stem cell lines kept ? .
All of the 21 remaining federally approved stem cell lines are kept at the National Stem Cell Bank at WiCell Research Institute in Madison Wisconsin .
The last two approved lines were deposited in this stem bank January 12 .
For a fee researchers can apply for access to use stem cells for their research .
