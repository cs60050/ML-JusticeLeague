On a windy Saturday afternoon a group of Roma girls were selling trinkets on a beach outside of Naples .
Sometime during lunch time the girls set down their wares and ventured into a rough sea .
Two of the Roma cousins Violetta and Cristina aged 12 and 13 according to Cardinal Sepe struggled to stay afloat amid a strong rip tide .
Emergency services responded 10 minutes after a distress call was made from the beach and according to local press accounts two lifeguards attended the girls upon hearing their screams .
But they were too late .
Cristina and Violetta drowned .
Their bodies were pulled from the sea covered with towels feet exposed .
Witnesses say they lay on the beach for hours and so did many of the sunbathers who allegedly watched the drowning and according to some press accounts did little but stare and carry on with their Saturday afternoon .
