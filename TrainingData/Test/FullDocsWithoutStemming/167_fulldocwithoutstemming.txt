Representatives of Iran film industry should only have an official meeting with representatives of the Academy and Hollywood if they apologize for the insults and accusations against the Iranian nation during the past 30 years said Javad Shamghadri Ahmadinejad advisor on the arts ISNA reported .
He singled out the 1991 Sally Field thriller Not Without My Daughter about an American woman who marries an Iranian and then tries to flee Iran with their child and the action flick 300 as two clear examples of total lies .
Do you think an apology is warranted ? .
TheHollywood delegation which ISNA said also includes AMPAS president Sid Ganis is supposed to meet with Iranian filmmakers and hold a news conference on March 7 .
The Academy did not immediately respond to a CNN request for comment .
But Shamghadri demanded to know how the meetings could produce results .
How can we sit and have a sincere meeting with American film makers while they they humiliate and insult the Iranian people and the great revolution of this nation ? .
he asked ISNA reported .
The Iranian nation and its revolution has repeatedly and undeservedly been attacked by Hollywood movies he said .
The film The Wrestler is the latest among them he said of the film for which Mickey Rourke received an Oscar nomination this year .
We know that even right now there are other films being made with the aim of insulting and accusing the great nation of Iran and its rich culture .
