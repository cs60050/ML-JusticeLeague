Experts meet to fight Mexican narcotraffickers .
MEXICO CITY Mexico CNN Ciudad Juarez was converted into a fortress as members of President Felipe Calderon security cabinet met Wednesday in the border town to devise a strategy to combat narcotraffickers .
Ciudad Juarez across the border from El Paso Texas is one of the most violent cities in Mexico with the vast majority of the violence tied to drug trafficking .
The secretary of the interior Fernando Gomez Mont who attended the meeting said the city remains under government control and promised greater cooperation between federal and local authorities .
Not a centimeter of the plaza will be ceded to them and we are going to expel them from Juarez he vowed referring to the narcotraffickers .
That is the gist of our promise and in that we put our word .
But last week the chief of police was obliged to quit after threats from organized crime to kill a policeman every day that he remained on the job .
A day later the mayor was threatened with death .
Leo Zuckerman a security expert who visited Juarez on Friday disagreed with Gomez view .
I can assure you that what we are seeing is the loss of control of the state on the society he said .
It is organized crime that is governing Ciudad Juarez ; they had the ability to force out the chief of police .
Some opposition legislators and even the mayor have asked Mexican federal authorities for more help .
The violence generated by the war of the drug cartels for control of drug routes translated last year into some killings .
More than of them occurred in Ciudad Juarez alone .
During the meeting of the security cabinet soldiers discovered an explosive at the airport authorities said .
