It was a very strong performance from us and it just showed that we are very competitive and that we did have any problems Hamilton said .
It going to be close with Ferrari but I feel strong I feel we can definitely challenge for the front row .
Hamilton was nearly of a second quicker than Ferrari Felipe Massa whose mark led the afternoon session until Hamilton went around fastest with about a minute left .
Tomorrow will be very close within a couple of tenths of a second Hamilton said .
Kimi Raikkonen was the only other driver to get under the mark .
The defending world champion ended up with a for Ferrari .
Teams had to battle the elements which included a gusting wind in the afternoon as the unseasonable weather forced questions over tire strategies for Saturday qualifying .
I feel I can claim we will be on the pace in any conditions said Massa who will likely opt for the softer tires .
It wo be a stroll in the park but we can take them on .
Mark Webber rounded out the day with a best lap of in his Red Bull .
Rain has hit three of the past four GPs with Hamilton winning two of the races to lead a tie at the top of Formula One championship ahead of Massa and Raikkonen .

The Briton along with most of the field with less than 30 minutes remaining and showers subsiding to a drizzle .

The sun emerged and the track temperature warmed up what Ferrari had been hoping for but no driver came close to matching Hamilton who showed his determination to follow up his victory at the British GP with an untouchable last lap .

Ferrari has won five since then with Michael Schumacher the last winner in 2006 .
Meanwhile Honda will stick with current drivers Jenson Button and Rubens Barrichello for 2009 team principal Ross Brawn said earlier Friday .
Clearly our priority is to sort the car out because we believe with the drivers we have if we produce a good car then they can produce from their side Brawn said .
So we are not looking at anything major on the driver side our main priority is the car .
Button however would not confirm whether he would stick with the team .
I would like to stay on next year because I think it a team with a great future Button said .
The Briton would not say if he had signed a deal for 2009 .
Being here next year would be great he said .
Barrichello coming off a finish at the British GP has 11 points to lead the team with Button at three .
Honda is eighth in the constructors standings with 14 points trailing leader Ferrari by 82 .
The car is not as competitive as we obviously want but I see a lot of reasons to be optimistic with the team .
I have seen the team move forward a long way Brawn said .
The Barrichello recently became the most experienced driver in Formula One history .
The former Ferrari and Jordan driver has competed in 257 races .
